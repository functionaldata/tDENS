# tDENS
Testing version of fdadensity

### What is this repository for? ###

This is R package implementation of the methodology proposed by Petersen & Mueller in the manuscript: "Functional Data Analysis for Density Functions by Transformation to a Hilbert space". 

### How do I get set up? ###

Assuming you can see this you should have access to this repo. Therefore just use clone the repo and then use `devtools` with `load_all()` to load the file. It should automatically compile the functions needed and get you going at no time (ie. `devtools::load_all('folder_you_cloned_all_this_stuff')`)

### But I just want to install it...
You can install the package in R using:
```
devtools::install_github("functionaldata/tDENS") 
```

Once installed you can load the package with:
```
library(fdadensity)
```


### Who do I talk to if I want somethig fixed/changed/added? ###

You can message Pantelis.
