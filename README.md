### What is this repository for? ###

This is R package implementation of the methodology proposed by Petersen & Mueller in the manuscript: "Functional Data Analysis for Density Functions by Transformation to a Hilbert space". 

### How do I get set up? ###

Assuming you can see this you should have access to this repo. 
Therefore just use clone the repo and then use `devtools` with `load_all()` to load the file. It should automatically compile the functions needed and get you going at no time (ie. `devtools::load_all('folder_you_cloned_all_this_stuff')`)

### Who do I talk to? ###

You can message Pantelis if you have any questions about using these functions.
